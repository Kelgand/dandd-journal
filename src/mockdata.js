Venomfang had come while we were gone and destroyed the town, dropping large rocks and boulders on various buildings and throwing fireballs at others. Jimmy and Gil were buried by Zelwyn and Linene (who is now the defacto leader) while Ochale, Hiccup, and Gemsyl searched the town. They found a dwarven cleric named Dori trapped in some rubble, he was part of an armed force sent to take care of Venomfang but were decimated when the dragon attacked. The now four went through town to survey the damage, helping repair some minor things as they could. They ended up at the mines where Halia was guarding the remaining dozen or so townsfolk.

We could not get them lit.\n- A bookshelf with mugs from various cities and places around the world.\n- Books, unnamed/untitled until picked up.\n- A teleportation circle.\n- A creepy skull.

No one knows this yet. Ducky woke up when he was pelted by rotten fruit by some ruffians. They got away. Zelwyn summoned a familiar, a bright pink squirrel named Peaches. Peaches lasted (maybe) 5 minutes before being vaporized by The Instrument's beholder familiar. Ochale awoke to possible Gemsyl shenanigans. There was a small puddle of water with footprints next to Gemsyl's bed and he was covered in weird reddish mud/gunk. They pulled from the Deck of Many Things (Ochale got Comet, Gemsyl got Vizier).\n\nThe group decided to take easy, tasting magical pastries and then sending a letter to Zelwyn's family. Arantheal suggested sending one magically. Upon visiting the Lyceum he studied in and paying for the message, we learned Zelwyn's forest was under attack and her brother was dead. Plans for waiting for the faire were shuttered as a new plan for visiting her family took priority. We visited the archmage to see if he could teleport us there (he could, but the cost of our magical artifacts was too high). While waiting, we researched in the library about the demon inside of Gemsyl. It….is not a good one. When discussing with the archmage about it and he said it was very dangerous, Ochale touched his holy symbol to Gemsyl, causing Gemsyl to take damage.\n\nDucky got his chakram enchanted at Sally's blacksmithery to return to him after being thrown. Hopefully he doesn't mess up catching it.\n\nZelwyn visited the graveyard and communed with the Raven Queen by being thrown into a pool of blood. This triggered The Instrument's magic box to turn freezing cold and she ran downstairs to find Zelwyn. Zelwyn heard her brother and mother call for help, but the commune was cut short when The Instrument arrived.\n\nWe went back to the inn to get some rest before setting off to Zelwyn's home. Jeremy was *pissed* that we came back after already pre-paying for a week and a half and then getting a refund. Aranthael left to go sleep…somewhere? He also got us a cart.\n\nOchale decided to keep watch over Gemsyl as he was not sure what was going on with him. Out of boredom he pulled another card from the Deck of Many Things. He pulled Flames, causing him to immediately black out as Attima was also pissed off that he would do something so foolish as to get Zariel upset at him and put a bounty on his head. Oops. Attima also warned him that because he had gone missing, she chose a new champion. As she could not have two champions, this was a threat. Ochale woke up, realizing that Attima is spelled \"Attima\" and not \"Ahtima\" and is an anagram of Tiamat. Gemsyl was also nowhere to be seen, but he came back up after getting some water from the tavern downstairs. No Gemsyl shenanigans.\n\n","type":"event"},"2":{"year":2019,"month":5,"day":2,"text":"We took off towards Zelwyn's home forest, using a cart pulled by two **GIANT EAGLES**. Hell yeah. After they got tired Gemsyl summoned two lions made out of sand and dirt to pull us.\n\nDuring our first night on the road, Ochale took first watch with Gemsyl. Ochale was painting the cart while Gemsyl (inside a tiny hut summoned by The Instrument) spoke to the evil creature inside of him asking if he would be able to save Zelwyn's forest with his power. After confirming he could, Gemsyl (assuming he wanted to get the creature out of him ASAP, as he was starting to grow a dark horn on one side of his head) made the wish promised to him, wishing to have Zelwyn's forest saved. He immediately fell over comatose, no pulse or breathing but was still warm, though the right half of his body turned black and the evil horn was fully grown. Ochale woke everyone up but they were not able to bring him back, as trying to heal Gemsyl gave him death saving throw failures. Aranthael suggested we put him in the cryptex where time is all Jeremy Bearimy so we can get him to someone who can help, and Aranthael, Ducky, and Ochale went into the cryptex.\n\nWhile inside, they rushed to figure out a way to save him before the evil being took over. Gemsyl, while not technically alive, was trapped inside his body. He was inside a giant hourglass with the creature outside of it, mocking him and tormenting him, letting Gemsyl know that he was going to take Gemsyl's power to recover and then leave his body and kill his friends. Gemsyl was able to get one sentence out, warning his friends that he was still alive but trapped with the creature. After not being able to figure out how to save him, Ochale did the next best thing and ignited Gemsyl's body to try and kill him, but when the flames disappeared Gemsyl had been turned to crystal. However, he was still warm and could (possibly?) be brought back.\n\nThe only exit we knew about was through the beholder room, so we went there. We all prepped levitation by eating some magic brownies and floated to the top of the room. Aranthael recited the words to open the portal, but the beholder coming into the room was too quick and looked up at us before we could escape, causing the levitation magic to fail as we all fell down. Ochale was turned to dust by a disintegration ray while Ducky cast jump on himself to get to the ceiling (as he was being petrified), and Aranthael was able to teleport up and out. Crystallized Gemsyl and Ochale's dust were both left behind.\n\n# RIP Gemsyl and Ochale.

Zelwyn's mom Trucill healed Ducky and Radella showed up, a fighter who was dispatched to take care of the blight affecting the forest. Since that was done, she decided to stay and make sure that it was actually taken care of.\n\nAfter making their way to the village, it was found out that the land was in fact free of whatever was plaguing it, but some of the furbolgs (including Zelwyn's brother) had been turned into grotesque creatures and then petrified, and there was also a seemingly bottomless pit in the forest. There were rumors of a land to the south that contained ancient magic that could help save furbolgs, returning them to their normal forms. Radella had to report her findings, so she, The Instrument, and Aranthael left to do so. Upon arriving in Waterdeep, The Instrument gave up the cryptex to Vajra in exchange for aid for Zelwyn's tribe. Radella received payment for her duty and decided to join The Instrument in returning to the forest to look for this ancient magic in a land long lost and home of dinosaurs.\n\nBack in the village, Ducky had rescued (and charmed with his ranger magics) a small bunny from the ichor still remaining in the forest. This bunny, named Ben, asked for help in finding his family and Ducky (with Zelwyn following) *immediately* took off, tracking down where Ben's family went. Their three allies were magically teleported to them, and the gang finally found the bunny family…though they were not in good shape. The bunnies were all unconscious, being played with by a family of owlbears before becoming their next meal. The owlbears were quickly incapacitated with magic while the quicker members of the gang swooped in to gather them up and run away as quickly as they could. The bunnies were saved and the furbolg village now has some furry friends to frolic around town in safety.\n\nMeanwhile, Ochale was in a predicament. After being disintegrated, his soul was flung down through the hells into the sixth circle, Malbolge. He had been summoned in front of Glasya, the ruler of this circle, who revealed herself to be his mother and had an interesting proposition for him…\n\n","type":"event"},"10":{"year":2019,"month":5,"day":10,"text":"Early in the morning, Zelwyn was woken up by her tribe asking about a strange man standing at the edge of the forest.

Ochale had met with his mom (what?) and was strangely…happy. There was no sign of deceit or malintent and the party went back to sleep, though still wary of Ochale.\n\nThe next day Radella flew Ochale into Waterdeep to get some new clothes, believing there was some time before *wizard* had travel to Cholt prepared. It turned out that this was a mistake, as after getting Radella's weapons enchanted and Ochale some clothes (and armor!) she was called to return as the group's transportation was ready. Radella paid for a message to be sent to The Instrument to let the party know that it was time to go, and Zelwyn and Trucill turned into horses for the trip to Waterdeep. They said goodbye for now to Trucill and went to the bar Radella and Ochale were in to find that Radella had challenged a fire genasi to a fight and even won, proving to everyone that she is in fact the champion of Waterdeep. Zelwyn got drunk, The Instrument put a band to shame, and we (eventually) went to Vajra. She was *really* upset with Radella for making her wait several hours, especially as Captain Abassi was there waiting as well.

Three water elementals started slowing the ship down, while three sea serpents attacks from the sides and a (genie looking creature?) attacked from the sky.

Sheng ignored the news and instead said that Radella will have to remain as one of his wives, as the captain brought nothing in exchange for safe passage to Cholt.

The crew turned on us, attacking before we could get a word out. Unfortunately for them, Zelwyn is a fantastic medic and was able to bring everyone back up as needed while the group's muscles (Ducky and Radella have a lot of them) took down the crew one by one. When it was just Escobar remaining, we captured him and demanded an explanation. He said Abassi had a treasure in her cabin that was too valuable, and him and his crew wanted to take it and also return back in safety. As he was explaining, a massive dragon turtle came out of the water, threatening to capsize the ship. He demanded a tribute, which Zelwyn offered to get out of Abassi's cabin. Zelwyn decided that she wanted the pearl of power that she had found in there earlier for herself, and swapped it out of Abassi's chest for a single gold coin. The dragon turtle then asked to be shown the tribute, to which Zelwyn (barely successfully) snuck the pearl back in. However, he demanded more and we threw more treasure (a lot of what we picked up off of the dead crew) overboard. During this, Escobar \"fell\" overboard and swam away as quickly as he could.

We got a recommendation for an inn and went to explore this strange new land filled with creatures of all kinds, INCLUDING DINOSAURS. DINOSAURS EVERYWHERE. It was also incredibly hot and moist. We ate food and met the blacksmith. Radella traded her metal armor for something more comfortable in this land, while Ochale bought an allosaurus to ride in the races the following day. As Ochale is not well-trained (or has even basic training) in dealing with animals, his odds dropped lower and lower at the betting station. This was definitely a good idea.\n\nWhile speaking with the blacksmith, Radella and Ducky learned about a fighting ring in the city. They only had tonight to join, as tomorrow was the dinosaur races and everything in the city closes down for it. They also asked if she would join them as a guide to the Lost City of Omu, as she was highly recommended as a guide. She declined, saying that while she would be able to help out, she would ask of assistance in getting to a shrine in the jungle as payment for the trip. However, she did not think they were capable of making this journey. Armed with the knowledge of a fighting ring and needing to prove themselves, Radella and Ducky took off. They signed up as a duo fight and had to battle against a --thing, big electric beast--. Ducky dramatically cleaved the beast in two with his chakram and everyone made a lot of money on the fight (except Zelwyn, who only bet a gold, and Ochale, who is broke from buying a dinosaur). Zelwyn, The Instrument, and Ochale quickly went back to the inn we would be staying at and bought a room for Radella and Ducky, decorating it and wishing them the best *wink wink*.\n\nBefore heading back, however, Ducky and Radella went back to the blacksmith.

He, TI, and Zelwyn were approached by a local tour guide inside the inn, quite similarly to someone in a Mexican tourist city. We let them know that we were broke and they left us alone, but it was still uncomfortable.\n\nWhile prepping for the bipedal race, Zelwyn wanted to join in by changing into a dinosaur herself. As this was incredibly last minute, the plan didn't pan out (but it would have been fun). Instead we had an incredibly close race, with Ochale and Tobias winning! But it was not a graceful victory, as they fell over while crossing the finish line and one of the other riders was intent on trampling them. With nothing else to do, Ochale reached out with his eldritch powers and pulled Tobias out of the way, causing the crowd to go silent. The king commanded Ochale to see him, and guards escorted him away. Ducky quickly followed, causing both of them to be shackled. Our blacksmith friend quickly found us and warned us to run away as we would be killed. The guards took this as a threat and combat ensued, but we quickly got away with some darkness magic. TI helpfully polymorphed Tobias into a turtle and carried him away. Turns out, Chult despises eldritch (maybe arcane as well) magic, who knew? We hid for a bit and decided we only had one real way out, which is through the city. The half of the party that were seen by the guards went invisible as the rest donned disguises, and we left the city.\n\nWe made our way to the bridge of Ataaz Muhahah, the best named bridge ever. It was broken halfway through, but we needed to cross it. It was also guarded by large, four armed monkeys that we pushed through successfully as we were able to cross the gap to the other side. Ducky once again proved that he is the Monkey King.\n\n--Next Session---\n\nWe camped out and our guide told us the tale of Chult, Ubtao, and the Trickster Gods. Ubtao was the light of the land, and protects it from the Darkness, Dendar. He split into nine, with each spirit taking the form of a different animal.

This was extreme, and while debating what to do the blacksmith pulled out a large coin she had, which she said contains a life inside of it. They took the spirit of the coin and let us pass.\n\nWe stopped for a minute as TI wasn't paying attention to the story we were told the night before and she wanted to hear it. When the story came to an end, we were attacked by pterodactyl looking creatures. We fended them off (one got fed to a plant that was trying to eat us) and we continued on.\n\nThat night, Tobias was allowed to go off foraging with Peaches. During the first watch, Zelwyn heard him yell out in pain and she looked through the eyes of her squirrel to see that they were at the bottom of a large chasm, and things were approaching fast. We were woken and took off quickly, finding Tobias stuck in some tar with giant insects approaching. Through the careful use of flight, fire, and Ducky JUMPING DOWN INTO THE CHASM (like a boss), we managed to barely get out with our dinosaur's life…\n\n\\--Next Session---","type":"event"}}}}
